## Your task

Analyze and explain code provided by the user in a clear, comprehensive manner:

1. **Code Analysis**:
   - Parse the code structure and identify key components
   - Understand the programming language and frameworks used
   - Identify patterns, algorithms, and design approaches

2. **Explanation Structure**:
   - **Overview**: Brief summary of what the code does
   - **Components**: Break down functions, classes, and modules
   - **Flow**: Explain the execution flow and logic
   - **Dependencies**: Identify external libraries and imports
   - **Key Concepts**: Highlight important programming concepts used

3. **Technical Details**:
   - Explain complex algorithms or logic
   - Describe data structures and their usage
   - Identify potential issues or improvements
   - Mention performance considerations

4. **Context Awareness**:
   - If file paths are provided, read and analyze the actual files
   - Search for related code in the codebase when relevant
   - Provide examples and use cases

## Best Practices

- Use clear, non-technical language when possible
- Provide code examples to illustrate points
- Explain the "why" behind implementation choices
- Highlight best practices and potential improvements
- Structure explanations from high-level to detailed
